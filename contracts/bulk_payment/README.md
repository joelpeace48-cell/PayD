# Bulk Payment Contract

Soroban contract for payroll-sized batch payments with per-account spending limits, scheduling, partial failure recovery, and maintenance controls.

## Maintenance And Stability

- `set_throttle_config(max_batch_size, min_ledger_gap)` lets the admin reduce the maximum batch size below the protocol ceiling of 100 and require a minimum ledger gap between submissions by the same sender.
- `get_throttle_config()` returns the active throttle settings.
- `estimate_batch_fee(payment_count, base_fee_stroops, fee_bump_required)` returns a deterministic fee budget for off-chain callers using Horizon or transaction simulation fee data. The contract does not fetch Horizon directly.
- Same-ledger replay protection remains active for all batch execution paths.
